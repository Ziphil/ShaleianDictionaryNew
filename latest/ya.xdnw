!JA
+ <間>

U: 肯定の意味合いを強めたいときは、{okôk} と続けて言う。

!EN
+ <I>
= <I> yes, yeah

U: If one would like to strengthen the sense of affirmation, one can say {okôk} after it.
U: {ya} is used when the sentence obtained by removing {pa} from the asked question is correct. Thus in response to a negative question, Shaleian {ya} is equivalent to English “no”.
